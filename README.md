DirList, a simple tool to recursively scan your directories

This is a tool created with Hollywood-MAL 9.1 + my HGui libraries to show how HGui can be used and how simple it is.

In this repository I will store the executables for all the platform supported by Hollywood, while the source code will be available only for my Patrons.

Executables are for:
- Amiga OS3
- Amiga OS3+FPU
- Amiga OS4
- AROS
- Linux ARM
- Linux PPC
- Linux x64
- Linux x86
- MacOSX PPC
- MacOSX x64
- MacOSX x86
- MorphOS
- WarpOS
- Windows 32bit
- Windows 64bit
